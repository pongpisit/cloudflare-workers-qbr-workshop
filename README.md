## What is Cloudflare?

**Cloudflare** is a company that provides internet services. Think of it like:

- **R2** = Cloud storage for images and files (like Dropbox)
- **D1** = Database to save information (like Excel in the cloud)
- **Workers AI** = AI models you can use (like ChatGPT)
- **Dashboard** = Website where you control everything (no coding required!)

**Why Cloudflare?**
- ⚡ **Fast** - Your app runs on 300+ servers worldwide
- 🆓 **Free** - Generous free tier for learning and small projects
- 🔒 **Secure** - Built-in security and DDoS protection
- 🌍 **Global** - Your app works everywhere instantly

## Do I Need to Know Programming?

**Short answer:** No! This workshop is designed for beginners.

**What helps (but not required):**
- Basic HTML (like `<h1>` tags)
- Basic CSS (colors, fonts)
- Basic JavaScript (variables, functions)

**Don't worry if you don't know these!** You'll be copying and pasting code, and we explain what each part does. You'll learn by doing.
