# About This Workshop

## Overview

This is a hands-on workshop for learning Cloudflare Workers using the **Cloudflare Dashboard** (no CLI required). It's designed for beginners with no prior experience with Cloudflare or serverless computing.

## Key Difference from CLI Workshop

| Aspect | CLI Workshop | Dashboard Workshop |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Setup** | Install Node.js, npm, Wrangler | Just a web browser |
| **Development** | Local development environment | Cloud-based editor |
| **Database** | Command-line tools | Dashboard console |
| **Deployment** | Manual CLI commands | One-click deploy |
| **Learning Curve** | Steeper (requires CLI knowledge) | Gentle (visual interface) |

## What You Will Build

By the end of this workshop, you will have built:

1. **Hello World Worker** - Your first serverless function
2. **Personal Profile Page** - A styled profile with links
3. **Image Gallery** - Store and serve images with R2
4. **Instagram-Style Photo App** - Upload photos with captions using R2 + D1
5. **AI Chatbot** - Chat with multiple AI models using Workers AI
6. **Complete Application** - Full-featured app deployed to the internet

## Technologies Used

| Technology | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Cloudflare Workers** | Serverless functions running on the edge |
| **Cloudflare R2** | Object storage for files (images, videos) |
| **Cloudflare D1** | SQLite database at the edge |
| **Workers AI** | AI models running on Cloudflare |
| **Cloudflare Dashboard** | Web interface for everything (no CLI) |
